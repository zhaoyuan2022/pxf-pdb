Introduction
============

PXF is an extensible framework that allows a distributed database like Greenplum to query external data files, whose metadata is not managed by the database.
PXF includes built-in connectors for accessing data that exists inside HDFS files, Hive tables, HBase tables, JDBC-accessible databases and more.
Users can also create their own connectors to other data storage or processing engines.

PXF Development
=================
Below are the steps to build and install PXF along with its dependencies including Greenplum and Hadoop.

To start, ensure you have a `~/workspace` directory and have cloned the `pxf` and its prerequisites (shown below) under it.
(The name `workspace` is not strictly required but will be used throughout this guide.)
```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace

git clone https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf.git
```
Alternatively, you may create a symlink to your existing repo folder.
```bash
ln -s ~/<git_repos_root> ~/workspace
```

## Install Dependencies

To build PXF, you must have:

1. GCC compiler, `make` system, `unzip` package, `maven` for running integration tests
2. Installed Greenplum DB

    Either download and install Greenplum RPM or build Greenplum from the source by following instructions in the [GPDB README](https://github.com/greenplum-db/gpdb).

    Assuming you have installed Greenplum into `/usr/local/greenplum-db` directory, run its environment script:
    ```
    source /usr/local/greenplum-db/greenplum_path.sh
    ```

3. JDK 1.8 or JDK 11 to compile/run

    Export your `JAVA_HOME`:
    ```
    export JAVA_HOME=<PATH_TO_YOUR_JAVA_HOME>
    ```

4. Go (1.9 or later)

    To install Go on CentOS, `sudo yum install go`. For other platforms, see the [Go downloads page](https://golang.org/dl/).

    Make sure to export your `GOPATH` and add go to your `PATH`. For example:
    ```
    export GOPATH=$HOME/go
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin
    ```

    Once you have installed Go, you will need the `ginkgo` tool which runs Go tests,
    respectively. Assuming `go` is on your `PATH`, you can run:
    ```
    go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
    ```

5. cURL (7.29 or later):

    To install cURL devel package on CentOS 7, `sudo yum install libcurl-devel`.

    Note that CentOS 6 provides an older, unsupported version of cURL (7.19). You should install a newer version from source if you are on CentOS 6.

## How to Build PXF
PXF uses Makefiles to build its components. PXF server component uses Gradle that is wrapped into the Makefile for convenience.
```bash
cd ~/workspace/pxf

# Compile & Test PXF
make

# Only run unit tests
make test
```

## How to Install PXF

To install PXF, first make sure that the user has sufficient permissions in the `$GPHOME` and `$PXF_HOME` directories to perform the installation. It's recommended to change ownership to match the installing user. For example, when installing PXF as user `gpadmin` under `/usr/local/greenplum-db`:

```bash
export GPHOME=/usr/local/greenplum-db
export PXF_HOME=/usr/local/pxf
export PXF_BASE=${HOME}/pxf-base
chown -R gpadmin:gpadmin "${GPHOME}" "${PXF_HOME}"
make -C ~/workspace/pxf install
```

NOTE: if `PXF_BASE` is not set, it will default to `PXF_HOME`, and server configurations, libraries or other configurations, might get deleted after a PXF re-install.

## How to Run PXF

Ensure that PXF is in your path. This command can be added to your .bashrc
```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/pxf/bin:$PATH
```

Then you can prepare and start up PXF by doing the following.
```bash
pxf prepare
pxf start
```
If `${HOME}/pxf-base` does not exist, `pxf prepare` will create the directory for you. This command should only need to be run once.

## Re-installing PXF after making changes
Note: Local development with PXF requires a running Greenplum cluster.

Once the desired changes have been made, there are 2 options to re-install PXF:

1. Run `make -sj4 install` to re-install and run tests
2. Run `make -sj4 install-server` to only re-install the PXF server without running unit tests.

After PXF has been re-installed, you can restart the PXF instance using:
```bash
pxf restart
```

## How to demonstrate Hadoop Integration
In order to demonstrate end to end functionality you will need Hadoop installed. We have all the related hadoop components (hdfs, hive, hbase, zookeeper, etc) mapped into simple artifact named singlecluster.
You can [download from here](https://storage.googleapis.com/pxf-public/singlecluster-HDP.tar.gz) and untar the `singlecluster-HDP.tar.gz` file, which contains everything needed to run Hadoop.

```bash
mv singlecluster-HDP.tar.gz ~/workspace/
cd ~/workspace
tar xzf singlecluster-HDP.tar.gz
```

Create a symlink using `ln -s ~/workspace/singlecluster-HDP ~/workspace/singlecluster` and then follow the steps in [Setup Hadoop](#Setup-Hadoop).

While PXF can run on either Java 8 or Java 11, please ensure that you are running Java 8 for hdfs, hadoop, etc. Please set your java version by seting your `JAVA_HOME` to the appropriate location.

On a Mac, you can set your java version using `JAVA_HOME` like so:
```
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`
````

Initialize the default server configurations:
```
cp ${PXF_HOME}/templates/*-site.xml ${PXF_BASE}/servers/default
```

# Development With Docker
NOTE: Since the docker container will house all Single cluster Hadoop, Greenplum and PXF, we recommend that you have at least 4 cpus and 6GB memory allocated to Docker. These settings are available under docker preferences.

<!-- TODO: Understand why this only works for 6.6 RPM and not latest GPDB6 -->
The quick and easy is to download the GPDB 6.6 RPM from Github and move it into the `/downloads` folder. Then run `./dev/start.bash` to get a docker image with a running GPDB6, Hadoop cluster and an installed PXF.

If you would like more control over the GPDB installation, you can use the steps below.

```bash
# Get the latest centos7 image for GPDB6
docker pull gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/gpdb-pxf-dev/gpdb6-centos7-test-pxf:latest

# If you want to use gdb to debug gpdb you need the --privileged flag in the command below
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -p 5888:5888 \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -p 5005:5005 \
  -p 8020:8020 \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  -p 50070:50070 \
  -w /home/gpadmin/workspace \
  -v ~/workspace/gpdb:/home/gpadmin/workspace/gpdb \
  -v ~/workspace/pxf:/home/gpadmin/workspace/pxf \
  -v ~/workspace/singlecluster-HDP:/home/gpadmin/workspace/singlecluster \
  gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/gpdb-pxf-dev/gpdb6-centos7-test-pxf:latest /bin/bash -c \
  "/home/gpadmin/workspace/pxf/dev/set_up_gpadmin_user.bash && /usr/sbin/sshd && su - gpadmin"
```

### Setup GPDB in the Docker image

Configure, build and install GPDB. This will be needed only when you use the container for the first time with GPDB source.

<!-- TODO: This may be because we no longer use greenplum-db-devel?-->
```bash
~/workspace/pxf/dev/build_gpdb.bash
sudo mkdir /usr/local/greenplum-db-devel
sudo chown gpadmin:gpadmin /usr/local/greenplum-db-devel
~/workspace/pxf/dev/install_gpdb.bash
```

For subsequent minor changes to GPDB source you can simply do the following:
```bash
~/workspace/pxf/dev/install_gpdb.bash
```

Run all the instructions below and run GROUP=smoke (in one script):
```bash
~/workspace/pxf/dev/smoke_shortcut.sh
```

Create Greenplum Cluster
```bash
source /usr/local/greenplum-db-devel/greenplum_path.sh
make -C ~/workspace/gpdb create-demo-cluster
source ~/workspace/gpdb/gpAux/gpdemo/gpdemo-env.sh
```

### Setup Hadoop
Hdfs will be needed to demonstrate functionality. You can choose to start additional hadoop components (hive/hbase) if you need them.

Setup [User Impersonation](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Superusers.html) prior to starting the hadoop components (this allows the `gpadmin` user to access hadoop data).
```bash
~/workspace/pxf/dev/configure_singlecluster.bash
```

Setup and start HDFS
```bash
pushd ~/workspace/singlecluster/bin
echo y | ./init-gphd.sh
./start-hdfs.sh
popd
```

Start other optional components based on your need
```bash
pushd ~/workspace/singlecluster/bin
# Start Hive
./start-yarn.sh
./start-hive.sh

# Start HBase
./start-zookeeper.sh
./start-hbase.sh
popd
```

### Setup Minio (optional)
Minio is an S3-API compatible local storage solution. The development docker image comes with Minio software pre-installed. To start the Minio server, run the following script:
```bash
source ~/workspace/pxf/dev/start_minio.bash
```
After the server starts, you can access Minio UI at `http://localhost:9000` from the host OS. Use `admin` for the access key and `password` for the secret key when connecting to your local Minio instance.

The script also sets `PROTOCOL=minio` so that the automation framework will use the local Minio server when running S3 automation tests. If later you would like to run Hadoop HDFS tests, unset this variable with `unset PROTOCOL` command.

### Setup PXF

Install PXF Server
```bash
# Install PXF
make -C ~/workspace/pxf install

# Start PXF
export PXF_JVM_OPTS="-Xmx512m -Xms256m"
$PXF_HOME/bin/pxf start
```

Install PXF client (ignore if this is already done)
```bash
psql -d template1 -c "create extension pxf"
```

### Run PXF Tests
All tests use a database named `pxfautomation`.
```bash
pushd ~/workspace/pxf/automation

# Initialize default server configs using template
cp ${PXF_HOME}/templates/{hdfs,mapred,yarn,core,hbase,hive}-site.xml ${PXF_BASE}/servers/default

# Run specific tests. Example: Hdfs Smoke Test
make TEST=HdfsSmokeTest

# Run all tests. This will be very time consuming.
make GROUP=gpdb

# If you wish to run test(s) against a different storage protocol set the following variable (for eg: s3)
export PROTOCOL=s3
popd
```

If you see any HBase failures, try copying `pxf-hbase-*.jar` to the HBase classpath, and restart HBase:

```
cp ${PXF_HOME}/lib/pxf-hbase-*.jar ~/workspace/singlecluster/hbase/lib/pxf-hbase.jar
~/workspace/singlecluster/bin/stop-hbase.sh
~/workspace/singlecluster/bin/start-hbase.sh
```

### Make Changes to PXF

To deploy your changes to PXF in the development environment.

```bash
# $PXF_HOME folder is replaced each time you make install.
# So, if you have any config changes, you may want to back those up.
$PXF_HOME/bin/pxf stop
make -C ~/workspace/pxf install
# Make any config changes you had backed up previously
rm -rf $PXF_HOME/pxf-service
yes | $PXF_HOME/bin/pxf init
$PXF_HOME/bin/pxf start
```

# IDE Setup (IntelliJ)

- Start IntelliJ. Click "Open" and select the directory to which you cloned the `pxf` repo.
- Select `File > Project Structure`.
- Make sure you have a JDK (version 1.8) selected.
- In the `Project Settings > Modules` section, select `Import Module`, pick the `pxf/server` directory and import as a Gradle module. You may see an error saying that there's
no JDK set for Gradle. Just cancel and retry. It goes away the second time.
- Import a second module, giving the `pxf/automation` directory, select "Import module from external model", pick `Maven` then click Finish.
- Restart IntelliJ
- Check that it worked by running a unit test (cannot currently run automation tests from IntelliJ) and making sure that imports, variables, and auto-completion function in the two modules.
- Optionally you can replace `${PXF_TMP_DIR}` with `${GPHOME}/pxf/tmp` in `automation/pom.xml`
- Select `Tools > Create Command-line Launcher...` to enable starting Intellij with the `idea` command, e.g. `cd ~/workspace/pxf && idea .`.

## Debugging the locally running instance of PXF server using IntelliJ

- In IntelliJ, click `Edit Configuration` and add a new one of type `Remote`
- Change the name to `PXF Service Boot`
- Change the port number to `2020`
- Save the configuration
- Restart PXF in DEBUG Mode `PXF_DEBUG=true pxf restart`
- Debug the new configuration in IntelliJ
- Run a query in GPDB that uses PXF to debug with IntelliJ
