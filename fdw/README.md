# PXF Foreign Data Wrapper for Greenplum and PostgreSQL

This Greenplum extension implements a Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) for PXF.

PXF is a query federation engine that accesses data residing in external systems
such as Hadoop, Hive, HBase, relational databases, S3, Google Cloud Storage,
among other external systems.

### Development

## Compile

To compile the PXF foreign data wrapper, we need a Greenplum 6+ installation and libcurl.

    export PATH=/usr/local/greenplum-db/bin/:$PATH

    make USE_PGXS=1

## Install

    make USE_PGXS=1 install

## Regression

    make installcheck
