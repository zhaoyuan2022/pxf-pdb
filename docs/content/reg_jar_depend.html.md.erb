You use PXF to access data stored on external systems. Depending upon the external data store, this access may require that you install and/or configure additional components or services for the external data store.

PXF depends on JAR files and other configuration information provided by these additional components. The `$PXF_HOME/conf/pxf-private.classpath` file identifies PXF internal JAR dependencies. In most cases, PXF manages the `pxf-private.classpath` file, adding entries as necessary based on the connectors that you use.

Should you need to add additional JAR or native library dependencies, you must register these dependencies with PXF.

## <a id="reg_jar"></a> Registering a JAR Dependency

To add a JAR dependency for PXF, for example a MySQL driver JAR file, you must log in to the Greenplum Database master host, copy the JAR file to the PXF user configuration runtime library directory (`$PXF_BASE/lib`), sync the PXF configuration to the Greenplum Database cluster, and then restart PXF on each segment host. For example:

``` shell
$ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
gpadmin@gpmaster$ cp new_dependent_jar.jar $PXF_BASE/lib/
gpadmin@gpmaster$ pxf cluster sync
gpadmin@gpmaster$ pxf cluster restart
```

## <a id="reg_native"></a> Registering a Native Library Dependency

PXF loads native libraries from the following directories in this order:

1. The directories that you specify in the `$PXF_BASE/conf/pxf-env.sh` user configuration file `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` setting. Starting in PXF version 5.15.1, the `pxf-env.sh` file includes this commented-out block:

    ``` pre
    # Additional native libraries to be loaded by PXF
    # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=
    ```

2. The default PXF native library directory `$PXF_BASE/lib/native`.
3. The default Hadoop native library directory `/usr/lib/hadoop/lib/native`.

When you register a native library dependency with PXF, for example [Hadoop native libraries](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.9.2/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/NativeLibraries.html), you copy the native library to a location known to PXF *or* inform PXF of a custom location, and then you must synchronize and restart PXF.

You have three file location options when you register a native library with PXF:

- Copy the library to the default PXF native library directory, `$PXF_BASE/lib/native`, on only the Greenplum Database master host. When you next synchronize PXF, PXF copies the native library to all hosts in the Greenplum cluster.
- Copy the library to the default Hadoop native library directory, `/usr/lib/hadoop/lib/native`, on the Greenplum master, standby, and each segment host.
- Copy the library to the same, custom location on the Greenplum master, standby, and each segment host, and uncomment and add the directory to the `pxf-env.sh` `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` setting.


### <a id="reg_native_proc"></a> Procedure

1. Copy the native library file to one of the following:
    - The `$PXF_BASE/lib/native` directory on the Greenplum Database master host. (You may need to create this directory.)
    - The `/usr/lib/hadoop/lib/native` directory on all Greenplum Database hosts.
    - A user-defined location on all Greenplum Database hosts; note the file system location of the native library.

2. If you copied the native library to a custom location:

    1. Open the `$PXF_BASE/conf/pxf-env.sh` file in the editor of your choice, and uncomment the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` setting:

        ``` pre
        # Additional native libraries to be loaded by PXF
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=
        ```

    2. Specify the custom location in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` setting. For example, if you copied a library named `dependent_native_lib.so` to `/usr/local/lib` on all Greenplum hosts, your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` setting would look as follows:

        ``` shell
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
        ```

    3. Save the file and exit the editor.

3. Synchronize the PXF configuration from the Greenplum Database master host to the standby and segment hosts.

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ pxf cluster sync
    ```

    If you copied the native library to the `$PXF_BASE/lib/native` directory, this command copies the library to the same location on the Greenplum Database standby and segment hosts.

    If you updated the `pxf-env.sh` `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` setting, this command copies the configuration change to the Greenplum Database standby and segment hosts.

4. Restart PXF on all segment hosts:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ pxf cluster restart
    ```
