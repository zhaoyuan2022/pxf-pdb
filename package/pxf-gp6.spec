%description
PXF is an extensible framework that allows a distributed database like Greenplum to query external data files,
whose metadata is not managed by the database. PXF includes built-in connectors for accessing data that exists
inside HDFS files, Hive tables, HBase tables, databases that support JDBC, data stores (S3, GCS) and more.

# If a file is not marked as a config file, or if a file has not been altered
# since installation, then it will be silently replaced by the version from the
# RPM.

# If a config file has been edited on disk, but is not actually different from
# the file in the RPM then the edited version will be silently left in place.

# When a config file has been edited and is different from the file in
# the RPM, then the behavior is the following:
# - %config(noreplace): The edited version will be left in place, and the new
#                       version will be installed with an .rpmnew suffix.
# - %config: The new file will be installed, and the the old edited version
#            will be renamed with an .rpmsave suffix.
