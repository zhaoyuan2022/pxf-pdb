/**
 * ReadSamplingBridge wraps a ReadBridge, and returns only some of the output
 * records, based on a ratio sample. The sample to pass or discard a record is
 * done after all of the processing is completed (
 * {@code accessor -> resolver -> output builder}) to make sure there are no
 * chunks of data instead of single records. <br>
 * The goal is to get as uniform as possible sampling. This is achieved by
 * creating a bit map matching the precision of the sampleRatio, so that for a
 * ratio of 0.034, a bit-map of 1000 bits will be created, and 34 bits will be
 * set. This map is matched against each read record, discarding ones with a 0
 * bit and continuing until a 1 bit record is read.
