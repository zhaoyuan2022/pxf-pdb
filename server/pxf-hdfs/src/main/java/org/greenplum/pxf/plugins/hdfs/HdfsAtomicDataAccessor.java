/**
 * Base class for enforcing the complete access of a file in one accessor.
 * Since we are not accessing the file using the splittable API, but instead are
 * using the "simple" stream API, it means that we cannot fetch different parts
 * (splits) of the file in different segments. Instead each file access brings
 * the complete file. And, if several segments would access the same file, then
 * each one will return the whole file and we will observe in the query result,
 * each record appearing number_of_segments times. To avoid this we will only
 * have one segment (segment 0) working for this case - enforced with
 * isWorkingSegment() method. Naturally this is the less recommended working
 * mode since we are not making use of segment parallelism. HDFS accessors for
 * a specific file type should inherit from this class only if the file they are
 * reading does not support splitting: a protocol-buffer file, regular file, ...
